multicsproj
	Name: The Multics Project
	Founded on 1965
	#That's the date that GE and Bell Labs joined MIT in the project
	Reference: http://www.multicians.org/history.html
	Type: company
	#sort of
	Influenced by ctss
	Info: The multics project was an alliance between GE, Bell Labs, and MIT to produce the Multics operating system. All the partners in the project eventually withdrew except for GE, which sold its computer division to Honeywell, which (unsuccessfully) tried to commercialize Multics. The act of Bell Labs withdrawing from Project Multics in April 1969 left a Bell Labs programmer named Ken Thompson in a lurch, and a a result, Unix was born.

multics
	Name: The Multiplexed Information and Computing Service
	Date: 1969-10
	Reference: http://www.multicians.org/history.html
	Successor to ctss
	Made by multicsproject
	Type: OS
	Info: Although this is when Multics was first put out, it is acually still in use at some places. Because there was no place that put out boxed versions of Multics, this is the only multics node in the tree. The plug, however, was only pulled by Honeywell in July 1985.
