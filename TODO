Just about everything right now, but here are the big things:

Short Term-
	add a Type feld to the syntax to seperate OSes, hardware, languages, etc.
	flesh out the CP/M directory
	fix up the Unix directory
	finish the Linux node
###Make a Xerox PARC node and fill it in (this is now less important) (and done)
	flesh out the apple tree
	flesh out the motorola and intel trees


Mid Term-
	port it away from Graphviz (I don't like its licence, I just picked it up from the original project)
	extend into new families
	go further into the past (straight back to ENIAC)

Long Term-
	flesh out tree (/every/ OS that exists should find a node)
	begin Linux distro tree and other sub-trees
