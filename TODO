Just about everything right now, but here are the big things:

Short Term-
	add a Type feld to the syntax to seperate OSes, hardware, languages, etc.
	fix up the Unix directory
	flesh out the apple tree
	flesh out the motorola tree

Mid Term-
	extend into new families
	go further into the past (straight back to ENIAC)
	Add gif options to the Makefile
	finish the Linux nodes

Long Term-
	flesh out tree (/every/ OS that exists should find a node)
	begin Linux distro tree and other sub-trees
