OK, to keep stuff straight, here is a more specific form of the TODO file. Kurt and others, feel free to add to this. This is what we would like to see before each of the named versions are released.

(soon)
	Bring Mac OS 9/X trees up to date, Intel processors.
1.0
	Sun and SGI should have trees, and they should be partially complete


(someday)
	Apple hardware should be done

(maybe, if there's demand)
	A CGI script for on-the-fly manipulation of the tree through a web browser
