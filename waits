	Info: I joined McCarthy at Stanford in late 1965 and we subsequently put together the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) in an abandoned laboratory building in the foothills above the Stanford campus, near Felt Lake. The first computer there was a DEC PDP-6, installed in June 1966. After a false start with a contractor who couldn't deliver, a 6-console display system that drew text and vectors with a random-access electron beam was added in 1967. The computer system eventually evolved into a dual-processor DEC-10 and continued to provide display-based timesharing services to the Stanford community until 1992. It used a home-grown timesharing system called WAITS that was similar to TOPS-10 in outline but considerably different in detail.
