	Name: IBM OS/2 1.30 SE
	Date: 1991
	Reference: http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2History.html
	Info: The schism between IBM and Microsoft over OS/2 had come in 1990, so IBM alone was responsible for this and all future OS/2s. As a result, OS/2 1.30 was smaller, faster, and easier than the earlier versions of OS/2.
