OK, to keep stuff straight, here is a more specific form of the TODO file. Kurt and others, feel free to add to this. This is what we would like to see before each of the named versions are released.

	MacOS should be done (this includes OSX)
	POSIX should be current
	at least one node in use today should be traced back to ENIAC
	the Unix History tree should be completely merged in.

someday
