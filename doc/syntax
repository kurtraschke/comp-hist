OK, for all you people wondering how to make your own node, here are directions. I will put this in the form of a sample node, anything in parenthesies is my description.
Note:  If you are confused, that is a tab, not five spaces.  Todot(the parser) will choke if you give it spaces, so be careful when you copy/paste, and make sure the tab stays a tab.

fakenode (a node nickname)
	Name: Fake Node (this is what will show up on the final graph)
	Date: 2000-4-20 (this can be in yyyy-mm-dd, yyyy-mm, or yyyy format)
	Reference: A Website or book or paper (later I'm going to make a script that will make a bibliography)
	Successor to fakenode0 (this is for stuff like Windows 95 to 98)
	Code taken from foonode (like MS DOS 6.22 to Windows 95)
	Influenced by barnode (like CP/M to QDOS)
