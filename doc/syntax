OK, for all you people wondering how to make your own node, here are directions. I will put this in the form of a sample node, anything in parenthesies is my description.

fakenode (a node nickname)
	Name: Fake Node (this is what will show up on the final graph)
	Date: 2000-4-20 (this can be in yyyy-mm-dd, yyyy-mm, or yyyy format)
	Reference: A Website or book or paper ('make biblio' does a bibliography)
	Type: OS (can be one of OS os hardware standard or language)(this field is case sensitive and *required*)
	Info: this is a nonexistant node (this field places everything after Info: into a file called information in the dir you ran tovcg (no,todot doesn't do this) in)
	Aka fnode (this is for stuff with two names (as in Unicode and it's ISO standard name)
	Successor to fakenode0 (this is for stuff like Windows 95 to 98)
	Code taken from foonode (like MS DOS 6.22 to Windows 95)
	Influenced by barnode (like CP/M to QDOS)
	Runs on foovax (this should only be used for one-platform OSes, and even then only for the earliest possible hardware)
