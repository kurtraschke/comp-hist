		The Computer History Family Tree

OK, I guess I have to make a readme, so here it is. This is the computer family tree, a project to show /all/ the relationships between the various computer languages, operating systems, hardware, and standards. Our strong points are unix, cp/m and their derivitaves.

In order to be able to use this, you will need a copy of Graphviz <http://research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/> or VCG <http://www.cs.uni-sb.de/RW/users/sander/html/gsvcg1.html>. Also, you will need a Perl that is somewhere in the 5 range <http://www.perl.com>. To make a copy of where we are right now, type "make" in the top level directory.

If you want to make a node, look in TODO and doc/goals to see what we need done. Then look at the syntax in the doc/ directory. All contributions to this project from others would be appreciated.

	TIA for your help-
