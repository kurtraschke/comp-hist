		The Computer History Family Tree

OK, I guess I have to make a readme, so here it is. This is the computer family tree, a project to show /all/ the relationships between the various computer languages, operating systems, hardware, and standards, Right now, however, it's mostly Unix OSes, seeing as it is a (kind) fork of the Unix History Graphing Project <http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Unix_History/>

In order to be able to use this, you will need a copy of Graphviz <http://research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/> and a Perl that is somewhere in the 5 range <http://www.perl.com>. To make a copy of where we are right now, type "make" in the top level directory.

If you want to make a node, look in TODO and doc/goals to see what we need done. Then look at the syntax in the doc/ directory. 

	TIA for your help-
