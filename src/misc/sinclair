#Here are the machines made by that brilliant british inventor

mk14
	Name: Sinclair mk14
	Date: 1978
	Reference: http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/planet/index.html
	Type: hardware
	Info: Few now recall it, but the 1977 Microcomputer Kit 14 was Sinclair's first computer. Its sales were modest - about 50,000 - and its capabilities minimal, as it had a tiny memory, no tape storage and no VDU! However, its importance was far greater than might otherwise seem the case, as it showed Sinclair and Chris Curry, soon to found Acorn, that the future lay in home computers. Without the MK14, there probably would never have been a ZX81, Spectrum, BBC Micro or Archimedes, and the British computer scene would have been very different. 

zx80
	Name: Sinclair ZX80
	Date: 1980
	Reference: http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/planet/index.html
	Type: hardware
        Successor to mk14
	Info: The ZX80, launched in 1980 (sold for 330 UKP), is widely regarded as having founded the British home computer market. Although it is primitive compared even to the ZX81 and Spectrum, it laid the pattern for virtually every Sinclair machine to come. It was the smallest and cheapest computer in the world and was one of the first aimed at the home user, as opposed to the hobbyist. It's less well known now than the later Sinclair machines, probably because it sold "only" around 70,000, as against millions of ZX81s and Spectrums. Nonetheless, it marked a key point in the development of Sinclair and the British computer market.

zx81
	Name: Sinclair ZX81
	Date: 1981
	Reference: http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/planet/index.html
	Type: hardware
        Successor to zx80
	Info: Sinclair's third computer, the ZX81, was not "just another product" but a veritable phenomenon. By modern standards it is laughably primitive: only 1K of memory, no colour or sound, touch-sensitive keyboard... but back in 1981 the idea that a complete, working computer could be bought off-the-shelf for under £100 was almost unheard of. It sold millions, virtually created the British home computer market and made Sinclair a millionaire. And who could ever forget 3D Monster Maze, one of the greatest computer games ever? 

spectrum
	Name: Sinclair ZX Spectrum
	Date: 1982
	Reference: http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/planet/index.html
	Type: hardware
        Successor to zx81
	Info: Sir Clive's 1982 machine - it was indeed originally codenamed the ZX82 - has passed into computer folklore as the biggest-selling home computer of all time. It lasted until about 1992-93, went through four models, sold millions in Britain and across the world and even "inspired" clones in the USA, South America and Russia. It's still the focus of a tremendous amount of nostalgia, which has produced a remarkable quantity of on-line Spectrum material. (See the sidebar.) 

QL
	Name: Sinclair QL
	Date: 1984
	Reference: http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/planet/index.html
	Type: hardware
        Successor to spectrum
	Ingo: The QL was not a failure. That may seem to be a statement at odds with many people's recollections, but a micro which sells more than 100,000 and continues in use a decade later cannot be said to have flopped. What it did do, however, was to shatter Sinclair's reputation as a serious computer manufacturer: the QL saga highlighted, all in one place and at one time, all of the weaknesses in the Sinclair approach. The company never again regained its credibility, its financial standing was seriously damaged and the QL was the last 'new' computer which Sinclair Research ever produced. 

Z88
	Name: Sinclair Z88
	Date: 1995
	Reference: http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/planet/index.html
	Type: hardware
	Info: After the takeover of Sinclair Research by Amstrad in 1986, Clive established a new company, Cambridge Computers (he had sold the rights to the Sinclair name). It did not take him long to bring a new project to fruition - the Z88, a laptop Z80-based machine (though not a PC-compatible) with an LCD screen. It has proved surprisingly successful, though on a rather more modest scale than some of Sinclair's earlier computers.
